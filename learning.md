# Learning-Log
Tracking my front end dev learning process. Includes tutorials, articles and anything I found insightful. 


<br>
<h3>A Quick History</h3>
<hr/>
I've spent 8 years as a graphic designer. <br><br>
Failed terribly as a freelance designer for another 2.<br><br>
Then I turned 30.<br><br>
I made the switch to web design.<br><br>
Well, to Wordpress & page builders. <br><br>
Since then, I've been hacking my way through bad themes, plugin clashes and waaay too many !important overrides. <bR><br>
This is the point where I've decided to learn web development properly. <br><br>
To start with, I have a basic grasp of HTML & CSS.<br>And some basic WP PHP. But that's it. That's my starting point. <br><br>
So, I'm giving myself 3 years to get to where I want to be as a web developer.<br><br>
Along the way, I'll try and include as many tutorials, articles, links, tips & tricks as possible. <br><br>Hopefull this can become an easy-to-follow guideline for anyone else wanting to do the same thing. <br><br>


Cheers, Beek.

So to start with, I stumbled upon <a href="https://medium.com/@davesuperman/how-to-learn-front-end-web-development-for-free-in-5-days-25aa6021aa3b" target="_blank">this article</a> by Dave Bailey. It's fantastic. Full of great resoures, some of which I'll end up mentioning again here. <br><br>
I've also been doing <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=13tfIjw4QrI&list=PL2CB1F80266E986EA&index=8" target="_blank">this Sass Tutorial Series</a> by LevelUpTuts too. Super easy to follow. 

The other night I learnt the absolue basics of using NPM through Terminal. I'll come back to that in depth.

I also found this great article explaining the <a href="https://blog.teamtreehouse.com/wordpress-loop-beginners-guide" target-="_blank">Wordpress Loop.</a>

I'm logging everything in a personal, free <a href="https://app.asana.com/" target="_blank">Asana</a> account.<br>
This is super helpful for listing skills & areas I want to learn, and keeping track of what's next. Or what other JS frameworks could be cool to learn. This way if I'm tired after working a full day, I can just open up this project and pick the next thing to learn/watch. 

It's 10:30pm, and I'm about to start watching <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQojMIhELvM&list=PLoYCgNOIyGAB_8_iq1cL8MVeun7cB6eNc" target="_blank">this tutorial series</a> as a proper introduction to Web Dev.

Last week I took a break from learning code. I decided to finish a couple of books instead. <br>
I've jumped back into it this Monday just gone.<br><br>

The main introductary resources people seem to be recommending for front end development are:
<ul>
  <li><a href="https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/" target="_blank">Free Code Camp</a></li>
  <li><a href="https://www.codecademy.com/learn/learn-html" target="_blank">Code Academy</a></li>
  <li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/learncodeacademy" target="_blank">This Learn.Code Youtube Channel</a></li>
  <li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/LevelUpTuts" target="_blank">LevelUpTuts</a></li>
</ul><br>
As much as I want to kick straight into those, I figured getting a better grasp on Wordpress Development is more related to my current F/T job right now, so I'm going to deep dive on that.<br><br>

To make sure I don't get stuck in a 'Learning Procrastination Loop', at the end of each new skill (WP, static sites, JS frameworks, etc) I'm going to set a freelance $ goal to earn using that skill. So for WP, once I've spent the time studying it, I'll go out and try to generate $'X' worth of freelance jobs. It'll just be after hours and on wknds, so once that's done I'll move on those courses above. And because I REALLY want to do those courses, it'll put pressure on getting those extra freelance jobs done quickly! <br><br>

I'll check back in later and let you all know how this went! <br><br> 

So the updated plan looks like this:<br>
<ol>
  <li>Deepdive on Wordpress</li>
  <li>Make $'x' freelancing with ONLY WP sites</li>
  <li>Move onto next skill</li>
</ol>

I'll also curate a list of all the articles, videos, tutorials and resources I found the most useful whilst deepdiving on Wordpress. I figure that'll be really useful for other beginners.

I found <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ynA8_5jAc1s&list=PLpcSpRrAaOaqMA4RdhSnnNcaqOVpX7qi5" target="_blank">this tutorial series</a> on Wordpress. It's the basics. But honestly, when you've come from a theme/pagebuilder background, you just don't know most of these basics!<br><br>

Damn, I feel like an absolute beginner here. <br><br>

I guess I'm pretty decent at general design/UI already, so that's something.<br>
I feel like code, which has a yes/no answer (as opposed to design which is up to the viewer's discretion) may be quicker to learn anyway. <br><br>

This weekend I've spent a bit of time going through <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ynA8_5jAc1s&list=PLpcSpRrAaOaqMA4RdhSnnNcaqOVpX7qi5" target="_blank">this WP development tutorial</a>. It's incredible. It's so easy to follow and understand how everything works. I've honestly been using WP for the last year for client sites, and I've learnt more over the course of this weekend.
