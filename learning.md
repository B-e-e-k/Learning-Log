# Learning-Log
Tracking my front end dev learning process. Includes tutorials, articles and anything I found insightful.

<h3>A Quick History</h3>
<hr/>
I've spent 8 years as a graphic designer. <br><br>
Failed terribly as a freelance designer for another 2.<br><br>
Then I turned 30.<br><br>
I made the switch to web design.<br><br>
Well, to Wordpress & page builders. <br><br>
Since then, I've been hacking my way through bad themes, plugin clashes and waaay too many !important overrides. <bR><br>
This is the point where I've decided to learn web development properly. <br><br>
To start with, I have a basic grasp of HTML & CSS.<br>And some basic WP PHP. But that's it. That's my starting point. <br><br>
So, I'm giving myself 3 years to get to where I want to be as a web developer.<br><br>
Along the way, I'll try and include as many tutorials, articles, links, tips & tricks as possible. <br><br>Hopefull this can become an easy-to-follow guideline for anyone else wanting to do the same thing. <br><br>


Cheers, Beek.

Stumbled upon <a href="https://medium.com/@davesuperman/how-to-learn-front-end-web-development-for-free-in-5-days-25aa6021aa3b" target="_blank">this article</a> by Dave Bailey. It's fantastic. Full of great resoures, some of which I'll end up mentioning again here. <br><br>
I've been doing <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=13tfIjw4QrI&list=PL2CB1F80266E986EA&index=8" target="_blank">this Sass Tutorial Series</a> by LevelUpTuts too. Super easy to follow. 

The other night I learnt the absolue basics of using NPM through Terminal. I'll come back to that in depth.

I also found this great article explaining the <a href="https://blog.teamtreehouse.com/wordpress-loop-beginners-guide" target-="_blank">Wordpress Loop.</a>

I'm logging everything in a personal, free Asana account.<br>
Super helpful for listing skills & areas I want to learn, and keeping track of what's next. Or what other JS frameworks could be cool to learn. This way if I tired after working a full day, I can just open up this project and pick the next thing to learn/watch. 

It's 10:30pm, and I'm about to start watching <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQojMIhELvM&list=PLoYCgNOIyGAB_8_iq1cL8MVeun7cB6eNc" target="_blank">this tutorial series</a> as a proper introduction to Web Dev.
